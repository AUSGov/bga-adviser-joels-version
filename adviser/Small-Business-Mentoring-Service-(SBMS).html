<p>The Small Business Mentoring Service (SBMS) provides businesses locally and across Australia with low-cost mentoring to help them with marketing, finance, planning and all aspects of small business.</p>
<p>With around 200 mentors coming from a diverse range of industries and covering all skill areas, SBMS has a mentor that can help.</p>
<p>The SBMS local mentors are volunteers who understand the challenges small businesses face and have either owned a small business or worked in an organisation that has had strong links to small business.</p>
<p>Online mentoring is available to businesses across Australia during COVID, with face-to-face available where possible.</p>
